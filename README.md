# SET-Game
The goal is to read a collection of SET cards from standard input (stdin) and:
1. find and print the number of possible SETs of three cards in the input.       
2. find and print the largest disjoint collection of SETs in the input.
Input will contain an integer N, followed by a list of N distinct SET cards, one per line
Output: 1. A single line containing the number of possible SETs of three cards in the input.
        2. A single line containing the maximum number of disjoint SETs in the input.
        3. The cards forming a largest collection of disjoint SETs, each card on its own line and each
